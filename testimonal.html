I took lesson from others as well but he is obviously very knowledgeable and professional. I recommend him to everyone who wants to pass his driving test in a one go. My husband also took classes from him and he passed his road test in the first attempt at the Vancouver location. Thank you for your awesome service.</p>

                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> I had a fantastic experience with my driving instructor Bhagwant Singh(More like brother to me) He was not only willing to patiently explain things to me, even if I needed multiple explanations, but he also went extra mile by providing detailed instructions for every aspect of driving. Moreover, he played a vital role in my preparation of Class 5 test which I successfully passed with his guidance. Overall, I can confidently say that he is an exceptional teacher. I highly recommend him to anyone looking to learn how to drive.</p>
